This page is a continuous listing of new features and bug fixes for the
Functional Analysis through Hidden Markov Models software and server 
(http://fathmm.biocompute.org.uk).

## 5th July 2013 (v2.2)

* A new method for ranking nsSNPs according to disease concepts, i.e. disease-specific predictions, has been added.
* We now limit the number of web-based predictions shown; however, all predictions can be obtained in our tab-delimited report.
* We have fixed a number of small bugs.

* Human: updated pre-computed database to ENSEMBL 72, UniProt 2013_07, and RefSeq 59.

## 10th May 2013 (v2.2)

* We now use the Representative Proteome (RP) database when searching for homologous sequences.
* We now incorporate Pfam 27.0 into our domain-based predictions.
* We have fixed a minor database bug.

* Human: updated pre-computed database to ENSEMBL 71, UniProt 2013_05, and RefSeq 59.
